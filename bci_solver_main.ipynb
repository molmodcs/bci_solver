    "# Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the script is to recover information about the bond charge increments of a given interatomic interaction present in a chemical structure from the charges of each atom appearing in such structure. More precisely, given a chemical structure whose atoms are enumerated, the partial atomic charge $q_{j}$ of the $j$-th atom appearing in it is calculated through the MMFF94 force field as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_{j} = q_{I_{j}}^{0} + \\sum\\limits_{k \\, \\, \\text{bonded to} \\, \\, j} \\omega_{I_{k},I_{j}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "These values are so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $I_{j}$ refers to the MMFF94 atom type of the $j$-th atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $q_{I_{j}}^{0}$ is the integral or fractional formal atomic\n",
    "charge associated to the atom type $I_{j}$, while $\\omega_{I_{k}, I_{j}}$ refers to the bond charge increment (bci) resulting from the interaction between the bonded atoms $j$ and $k$ of types $I_{j}$ e $I_{k}$ - respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For any two given atom types $I_{j},I_{k}$, it holds that $\\omega_{I_{j},I_{k}} = - \\omega_{I_{k},I_{j}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, once we have knowledge of all the bci values for the atoms types which are present in a given structure, it is possible to obtain the atomic charges for any of its constituent atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, it is natural to ask if it is possible to regenerate within a good degree of accuracy the bci values $\\omega_{I_{k}, I_{j}}$ for a given enumerated structure with specified charges $q_{j}$ and $q_{I_{j}}^{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first insight, we notice that if we have any structure consisting of $N$ atoms:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_{j} - q_{I_{j}}^{0} = \\sum\\limits_{k \\, \\, \\text{bonded to} \\, \\, j} \\omega_{I_{k},I_{j}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Determines a system of $N$ linear equations and $M$ unknown values, which correspond to the $M$ unique bci values appearing in the structure. Thus, our proposed problem is equivalent to finding solutions to the following linear equation\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Delta q = B \\omega\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Where $\\Delta q$ is the vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ whose coordinates are specified by $q_{j} - q^{0}_{I_{j}}$, $\\omega$ being the vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{M}$ of unknown bci values $\\omega_{I_{k}, I_{j}}$, where we convention that $k < j$ and entries are sorted by lexicographic order, as well as: \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "B = (b_{rs})_{\\substack{1 \\leq r \\leq N \\\\ 1 \\leq s \\leq M}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "being the $N \\times M$ matrix of coefficients for each bci $\\omega_{I_{k}, I_{j}}$ obtained from connectivity information about the structure. As such, the matrix $B$ is meant to be so that for each $r$, the following equation holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_{r} - q_{I_{r}}^{0} =\\sum\\limits_{s=1}^{M} b_{rs} \\omega_{I_{j_{s}},I_{k_{s}}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow Halgren's previous approach and utilize a least squares method to find approximate solutions to the above-mentioned linear system of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure was implemented as a computer program written using Python and its libraries - NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib - for performing the necessary data manipulation, the least squares method and data visualization - respectively."
